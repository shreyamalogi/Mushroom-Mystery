# 🍄 Mushroom Mystery: Exploratory Data Analysis & Classification

This project focuses on analyzing a **mushroom dataset** to distinguish between **edible** and **poisonous** mushrooms using **EDA** and **machine learning models**. The goal was to explore key features, visualize data patterns, and build high-performing classifiers with real-world deployment in mind.

---

## 📌 Highlights

- **Cleaned & visualized** 20+ features using histograms, heatmaps, pairplots, and boxplots.
- Found strong indicators: `odor`, `cap-color`, and `population` directly influence mushroom class.
- Created and compared **7 models**:  
  ✅ Random Forest  
  ✅ Decision Tree  
  ✅ SVM  
  ✅ KNN  
  ✅ XGBoost  
  ✅ Logistic Regression  
  ✅ Naive Bayes
